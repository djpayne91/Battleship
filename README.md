# Battleship
Repository for my implementation of Battleship

It uses JavaFX and fxml files for the GUI along with Java for the controllers. <br>

Cross-platform support is still very shaky, but it currently works on Windows 10 with the latest JRE installed.

The easiest way to run it is:
<ol>
<li>Ensure you have the latest version of Java installed.</li>
<li>Download the included MyBattleship.jar file</li>
<li>Open a terminal and navigate to the location of the jar</li>
<li>run the command <code>java -jar MyBattleship.jar</code></li>
</ol>
